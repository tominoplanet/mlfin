    Fixed-Time Horizon Labelling Method
    Originally described in the book Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Chapter 3.2, p.43-44.
    Returns 1 if return for a period is greater than the threshold, -1 if less, and 0 if in between. If no threshold is
    provided then it will simply take the sign of the return.
    :param close: (pd.Series) Close prices over fixed horizons (usually time bars, but can be any format as long as
                    index is timestamps) for a stock ticker.
    :param threshold: (float or pd.Series) When the abs(change) is larger than the threshold, it is labelled as 1 or -1.
                    If change is smaller, it's labelled as 0. Can be dynamic if threshold is pd.Series. If threshold is
                    a series, threshold.index must match close.index. If threshold is negative, then the directionality
                    of the labels will be reversed. If no threshold is given, then the sign of the observation is
                    returned.
    :param look_forward: (int) Number of ticks to look forward when calculating future return rate. (1 by default)
                        If n is the numerical value of look_forward, the last n observations will return a label of NaN
                        due to lack of data to calculate the forward return in those cases.
    :param standardized: (bool) Whether returns are scaled by mean and standard deviation.
    :param window: (int) If standardized is True, the rolling window period for calculating the mean and standard
                    deviation of returns.
    :return: (pd.Series) -1, 0, or 1 denoting whether return for each tick is under/between/greater than the threshold.
                    The final look_forward number of observations will be labeled np.nan. Index is same as index of
                    close.
